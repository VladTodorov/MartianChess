# MartianChess
Martian Chess is a chess-like strategy game created by by Andrew Looney in which location, rather than
piece color, determineswhich pieces you may move. The game ends when someone runs out of pieces, and
the winner is the player who captured the most points.(http://www.wunderland.com/icehouse/MartianChess.html)

The purpose of this project is to create an online playable version of this game.
